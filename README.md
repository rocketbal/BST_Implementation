# BST_Implementation

<!-- NOTE: This is a Binary Search Tree data structure implementation. The implementation uses two classes.
First one is TreeNode and second is a BinarySearchTree(BST). TreeNode class initialize a node with two children
and a reference to the parent node. It also contains some helper methods. The BST class implements insert, remove
and traverse methods as well as methods to find min and max vals in the tree.  -->
